# Temp-Est-Visual-Weather
This is the code for a RPi driven lamp that shows the forecasted high and low for the day as individual colors along with the current temp in a color. It will continue to make API calls throughout the day to adjust the current temp's color. 

This code is made to be run on a RPi with a 156 light addressable LED light strip.

weatherlight.py - this is a file has a gradent from 10 degrees up to 100 degrees
weatherlightsummer.py - this file is better for warmer temps as it goes from 50 degrees to 100 degress as the temp range
